# 99Bottles implements the popular long-trip-car-song "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall."

## **Rules**
The song is quite simple, and really only has a few variations. To make it a bit more difficult I included the conversion of the numbers to their text equivalent. This introduces the need to properly initcap the number words at the beginning of the verse, and lower case following the comma. The other knows issue is handling the pluralization of the word "bottle" and the special case for 0 such that it is more linguistically pleasing to the ear, and effectively restarts the song. 

## **Code**
The source code is Java. Using gradle build. The unit tests, however, are currently using JUnit though they may later be converted to Spock. 

## **Suggestions**
This code is intended as an exercise for me to apply my learning of Java. I am quite open to suggestions and recommendations for improvement.

## **License**
If you wish to use any of this code for personal and/or educational purposes you may freely do so as long as you do not claim it as your own. Give a guy a little credit if you use his work.

If you wish to make money with this code, such as publishing it in a tutorial or making a salable product I want a cut of the action. As unlikely as this may be, simply contact me, so we can work out the details.
